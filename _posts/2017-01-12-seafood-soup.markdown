We wanted a simple mock community to serve as a positive control for our
future experiments.

We decided to mix together three examples of tasty seafood, purchased
from a local fishmonger in Leith.

Although this was mainly an exercise in finding what we knew we had
already, this experiment could have potentially useful applications,
for example determining between different species of fish.


## Methods

We took a single mussel, an oyster and a scallop. The species designations
were not known and we forgot to ask if - for example - the oyster was
a native or a Pacific oyster.

We also took several critters that we identified by eye from the shoreline.


## Basic protocol
